Some Comments From My Students:
* "Being a summer semester I think that Prof. Li developed a well structured class so that all his students can complete it successfully."
* "keep being attentive to students' needs. i think the professor does a good job at accommodating to everyone's needs and responds in short times."
* "The study sessions and office hours most definitely should continue because they really helped me thoroughly understand the mathematical questions while applying the formulas we learn during lecture."
* "Professor Li is very intelligent and very knowledgeable. He did everything in his power to accommodate the classroom and help student succeed."
* "I liked how Professor Li distributed the week. Mondays were homework review. From Tuesday to Thursday the weekly lectures and on Fridays office hours. By distributing time effectively, it gave the students the option of preparing their questions and succeeding in his class."
